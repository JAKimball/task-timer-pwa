# A visual task timer for corner-of-the-eye time awareness

## Todo

- [x] Add auto-animate
- [ ] Use src attribute selector to spin all react logos
- [ ] Add deploy and preview branches (how do Netlify previews work?)
  - [ ] Lock-down these branches (don't want someone else pushing code to my cloudflare workers!)
- [ ] Set up wrangler with github actions to deploy the deploy and preview branches on cloudflare
